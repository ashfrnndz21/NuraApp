"""Safety: the rules that sit under reasoning, not on top of it.

`high_risk` is the label-photo rule for a high-risk drug (docs/medications-module.md §9,
E16-04): a dose of one is saved from a label photo, never from a message or a voice note
alone. It is a hook on the memory store, so it holds whichever surface writes the fact.

`plain_words` is the verifier behind `make plain-words` (docs/plain-words.md, E22-01): every
string tagged `@patient` passes the standard or does not ship, and `plain_words.verify` is the
same check for the memos and cards the backend writes at run time.

The boundary copy and the red-flag rules arrive with their own stories.
